# RSpec TextMate Bundle

## TextMate Bundle for RSpec-1 and RSpec-2

This TMBundle works with both rspec-1 and rspec-2. Given that they work
differently, the TMBundle tries its best to figure out which one you're using
in each project.

If you're using Bundler in your project, the TMBundle will always do the right
thing based on the version of RSpec specified in your Gemfile.

If you're not using Bundler, the TMBundle tries to do the right thing based the
presence of assorted files and paths in your project. Obviously, everybody's
environment is going to be a bit different, so let us know if this doesn't work
for you by filing an issue at
[http://github.com/rspec/rspec-tmbundle](http://github.com/rspec/rspec-tmbundle)
and we'll do our best to resolve the situation.
